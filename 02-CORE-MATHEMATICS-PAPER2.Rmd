**Question 10:**

a. A group of 50 girls were asked which of the three colours: red, yellow and green they liked. 5 of then said they liked all three colours, 25 liked red and 22 liked green. 15 liked red and yellow, 12 liked red and green, 4 liked only yellow and 2 liked only green.
    i. Illustrate the information on a Venn diagram.
    ii. How  many girls did not liked any of the three colours?

b. A shopkeeper bought 150 articles and paid 40,000.00 cedis for transporting them to her shop. The articles were marked for sale at 10,000.00 cedis each. The shopkeeper sold 90 of them at this price and the remainder at a discount of $30\%$ on the marked price. Altogether she made a profit of $32\%$ on the total amount she spent. Calculate the amount she paid for each article.
